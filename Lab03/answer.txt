Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. 
	  Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: No, we can't since both title and category are of type String, if we construct an object with this type, 
	it cannot choose which field it will create. 

Question: Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. 
	  Compared to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
Answer: I'm not sure what "arbitrary" exactly means, but if it's something like we can decide number of dvds to add into the cart, 
	then I will use each in specific case cause each has its own pros and cons. If I want to add many dvds of the same type to
	cart, I will prefer "arbitrary" type, I don't need to add again and again attributes for that dvd since it takes extra time.	 
	If I want to add different dvds to cart, then I prefer "array" type, It's too annoying to keep adding (dvd_X, 1) in the other case.
