Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. 
	  Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: No, we can't since both title and category are of type String, if we construct an object with this type, 
	it cannot choose which field it will create. 

Question: Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. 
	  Compared to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
Answer: public void addDigitalVideoDisc(DigitalVideoDisc... dvd) {
		int num_added = 0;
		for (int i=0; i<dvd.length; i++) {
			if (qtyOrdered < MAX_NUMBERS_ORDERED) {
				itemsOrdered[qtyOrdered] = dvd[i];
				qtyOrdered += 1;
				num_added += 1;
				System.out.println("DVD has been added");
			}
			else {
				System.out.println("The cart is full");
			}
		}
		System.out.println("Number of disc added: ");
		System.out.println(num_added);	
	}
	I think it's the same, with varags, it's more flexible to add either just one instance or many instances through list.
