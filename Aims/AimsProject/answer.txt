If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
Answer:
- To warn the user about it, I use instanceof so that whenever the passing object isn't a Media instance, it'll return false.

The Comparable interface is part of the Java class library. It is in java.lang package, so no import 
statement is needed. Which method(s) do you need to implement from this interface?
Answer:
- The compare() method.

Create an ArrayList of Media, then add some media (CD, DVD, or Book) to the list.
Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using the toString() method. 
Observe what happens and explain it in detail.
Answer:
- Although the elements of list are casting to type Media, when iterating through and printing result by toString() method, 
each element still displays the toString() method that class implements, not the toString() method in Media class. This is 
called dynamic binding, the type of object is determined during the execution of the program.

Answer:
			AWT					|| 				Swing
Container      ||      Frame                                    || 	      		       JFrame
Class name     ||             Every class name in Swing is almost the same compare to that of AWT, it also has a J 
					at the beginning of every class name to differentiate from AWT
Event handling ||    The Components are set up in Frame		|| 	The JComponents are not added onto top-level container JFrame
								||	Instead it's add to content-pane of JFrame 
Scene	       ||  Default background color is white		||	Default background color is gray
		   Can't close the window if don't set up from  ||  Can close the window but in fact, it is still running, we still 
		   beginning					||  have to set up it 
		   					The others is the same
